## Patches

### My Telenor (`com.telenor.pakistan.mytelenor`)

_Supported version(s): 4.2.62_

| Patch | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Block trackers** | Stops the Insider, TikTok Business SDK and Mixpanel Session Replay trackers from initializing (event/attribution/session-replay tracking never starts). Leaves AWS Amplify, Firebase core/RemoteConfig/FCM and Google Ads init untouched so app data, push and the remote ad-config the ads patch relies on keep working. |
| **Block trackers (manifest flags)** | Disables Firebase Analytics + Google advertiser-id auto-collection and the Facebook SDK's auto app-events / advertiser-id / auto-init via AndroidManifest <meta-data> flags — the SDK-side auto-collection that no bytecode init-stub can reach. Leaves Firebase core (FCM push, RemoteConfig) and the Facebook ContentProvider intact. Separate from the bytecode Block trackers patch so you can pick either or both. |
| **Remove ads** | Removes every Google Ad Manager ad (banners + interstitials) across Daily Rewards, Home, Test Your Skills and Explore by nulling the remote ad-config chokepoint, so each surface renders its no-ads layout and never requests an interstitial. |

### Investify (`com.blueinklabs.investifystocks.free`)

_Supported version(s): 5.6.0_

| Patch | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Bypass PairIP license check** | Disables Google PairIP's license/installer check (com.pairip.licensecheck) so a re-signed build runs on a real device instead of being redirected to the Play Store and killed. No-ops the LicenseContentProvider entry point and LicenseClient.initializeLicenseCheck(). |
| **Unlock premium (remove ads)** | Unlocks Investify premium — forces the backend `no_ads` entitlement getter to report true in both the model and its Realm proxy, so the app treats the account as ad-free without any purchase. Ad SDK loads are gated on this flag app-wide. |

### Simosa (`com.jazz.jazzworld`)

_Supported version(s): 3.3.2_

| Patch | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Bypass signature verification** | Disables Simosa's anti-tamper signature check so a re-signed APK launches normally instead of stalling on the splash / "version is not correct" dialog. |
| **Remove ads & tracking** | Removes every ad (interstitial, banner, daily-reward) and every tracker (Mixpanel, Firebase, Facebook, AppsFlyer) — app events, network sends, ad-SDK requests (Google Ads / AppLovin / AnyMind / Prebid), SDK auto-collection, and the ipify IP leak. The app then phones home only to its own Jazz API. |

### MyZong (`com.zong.customercare`)

_Supported version(s): 5.19.19.112_

| Patch | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Remove ads & tracking** | Removes every ad (AdMob) and every tracker (Firebase Analytics, AppsFlyer, Facebook, TikTok, and the Veridium SDK's own Google Analytics) — event sends, full SDK init (AppsFlyer init, TikTok initializeSdk/startTrack, MobileAds.initialize), and auto-collection. Pushwoosh push is left intact. The app then phones home only to its own Zong API. |
| **Unlock daily reward (skip ad)** | Claim MyZong's daily reward with no 'watch ad' popup and no ad. Forces the reward-bubble tap to take the app's own direct-claim branch (the same claim call the post-ad path makes), upstream of both the popup and the rewarded ad. |

### NetMonster (`cz.mroczis.netmonster`)

_Supported version(s): 3.4.1_

| Patch | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Unlock premium (NetMonster)** | Unlocks NetMonster Premium — forces the premium repo's derived flows so real-time LTE/NR-NSA location calculation is unlocked, ads are removed, and the status shows Active (far-future expiry) without an Adapty subscription. |

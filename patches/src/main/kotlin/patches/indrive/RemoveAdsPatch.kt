/*
 * inDrive does not render Google's ads directly from its own UI code — every Google placement
 * (banner, native/video card, interstitial, carousel) is brokered by inDrive's own "promo platform"
 * module, which asks Google's Mobile Ads SDK for a creative only when a set of *feature toggles*
 * say so. Those toggles are real, server-driven production switches: inDrive ships them so a region
 * (or a single placement) can have Google ads turned off remotely without an app release.
 *
 * So the kill switch already exists in the app — it just answers "on" by default. This patch makes
 * the app answer "off" for every Google-Ads toggle, which puts the app on its own supported
 * ads-off code path instead of inventing a hook: the promo platform skips the ad request entirely,
 * so there is no creative to render and no ad-load failure to crash on.
 *
 * Where it is applied matters. Rather than neutralizing the ~30 call sites that read these toggles
 * (each one a chance to miss the placement the user is actually seeing), the patch hooks the single
 * hooks the single resolver every read goes through — the feature-toggle repository's boolean accessor
 *     c(<Toggle>;Z)Z      // resolve(toggle, default)
 * and returns `false` when the toggle handed in is one of the Google Ads ones. One injection point
 * therefore covers every placement and every future placement, including reads made directly by the
 * ad-delivery coroutine rather than through the promo platform helpers.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT touched:
 *  - `PROMO_PLATFORM_MAIN_GATE_ENABLED` (the promo platform as a whole) and
 *    `PROMO_PLATFORM_MAIN_GATE_PROMO_ENABLED` — those gate inDrive's own promo/coupon surfaces,
 *    which are not ads and are not what was asked for.
 *  - `PROMO_ADS_PANGLE_DISABLED` — that toggle is inverted ("isDisabled", default true); forcing it
 *    false would *enable* a network rather than disable one.
 *  - the manifest's Google Ads application id: removing it converts "no ads" into an
 *    IllegalStateException on the first ad call, i.e. a crash on the screen that used to show an ad.
 *
 * The toggle objects are compared by identity against the public singleton accessors, so the patch
 * depends only on `PromoPlatformToggleConstants` — a non-obfuscated, published API-module class —
 * and not on any R8-renamed helper name.
